# DataGrouper user manual

## Introduction
DataGrouper was written by @SchwartzNU for experimenters who do not want to suffer the curse of SQL and data query. This GUI features:
‚ö°Ô∏è Fast
üçá Fruitful
üí® Easy Breezy
üßë‚Äçüíª No coding require

SIKE. It's pretty slow. Be patient. Don't click too fast.

## Requirement
- Setup Datajoint (refer to [onboarding guide]() for MATLAB and Datajoint setup).
- FSMResfile mounted.
- [DJ_schwartzlab](https://github.com/SchwartzNU/DJ_schwartzlab/tree/master) is cloned, pulled and on MATLAB PATH.
- VPN / FSM Ethernet connection.


## Starting DataGrouper
1. Start MATLAB.
2. Type `DataGrouper` in the Command Window. Hit Enter.
3. Wait until the `Attributes` section on the left changes from `Item 1`, `Item 2`, ... to different attributes (figure below), and the window centers on your screen before doing anything else.
